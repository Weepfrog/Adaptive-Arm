Project summary:
    The robot arms main obective was to have 2 main modes:
        1. move from one position to another and then pour the ingridents in a bowl
        2. moves the arm back and forth to stirr ingridents in the bowl with a wisk

Usage Summary:
    1. The lcd was used to display what mode the arm was currently in and the two buttons are used to cycle through the modes and then select a mode. 
    2. Once a mode has been selected there is a button imput using a TRS imput jack to allow the use of standard adaptive buttons to activate the command.
    3. The arm also has two buttons that should have a zeroing function that should activate when the arm gets turned on. 
 

Issues with the project are as follows:
    Necisary for basic function:
        1. Fix the code so that when the user button is pressed an action occurs
    Reach goals for fix:
        1. Intigreate the LCD and mode control buttons to allow for the use of differnt modes

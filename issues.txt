we have many issues with our code. The robot arms main obective was to have 2 main modes, one to move from one position to another and then pour the liquid in the end effector and one the moves the arm back and forth to stirr stuff with a wisk. The lcd was used to display what mode the arm was currently in and the two buttons are used to cycle through the modes and then select a mode. once a mode has been selected there is a button imput using a headphone imput jack that allows paitents to hook their buttons up to it to activate the command. The arm also has two buttons that should have a zeroing function that should activate when the arm gets turned on. Unfourtunately we have had issues with flashing the arduino and ran out of time. I leave this here in hopes that somone will come to finish this project. Thanks :C:
